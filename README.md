# OpenHands Extensions

This repository is the **public extensions registry** for [OpenHands](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands).
It contains reusable, shareable skills and plugins that customize agent behavior.

- Skills overview docs: https://docs.openhands.dev/overview/skills
- SDK skill guide: https://docs.openhands.dev/sdk/guides/skill

## Repository Layout

### Skills

Skills are Markdown-based guidelines that provide domain-specific knowledge and instructions.
They live under `skills/`, **one directory per skill**:

- `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` — the skill definition (AgentSkills-style progressive disclosure)
- `skills/<skill-name>/README.md` — optional human-facing notes/examples

Browse the catalog in [`skills/`](skills/).

### Plugins

Plugins are extensions with executable code components (hooks, scripts).
They live under `plugins/`, **one directory per plugin**:

- `plugins/<plugin-name>/SKILL.md` — the plugin definition
- `plugins/<plugin-name>/hooks/` — lifecycle hooks
- `plugins/<plugin-name>/scripts/` — utility scripts

Browse available plugins in [`plugins/`](plugins/).

### NPM Package

This repository also publishes catalog data through the `@openhands/extensions` package. It requires Node.js 18.20.0 or newer because the catalog entry points import JSON modules with import attributes.

```js
import { AUTOMATION_CATALOG, INTEGRATION_CATALOG } from "@openhands/extensions";
import { INTEGRATION_CATALOG as MCP_MARKETPLACE } from "@openhands/extensions/integrations";
import { AUTOMATION_CATALOG as RECOMMENDED_AUTOMATIONS } from "@openhands/extensions/automations";
```

React logo components are isolated behind a separate export so data-only consumers do not need React peer dependencies:

```js
import { INTEGRATION_LOGOS } from "@openhands/extensions/integrations/logos";
```

See [`integrations/README.md`](integrations/README.md), [`automations/README.md`](automations/README.md), and [`MIGRATION.md`](MIGRATION.md) for catalog-specific details.
