# State File Schema

The automation maintains a JSON state file that persists across polling runs.
This file is the source of truth for which conversations are active, which
timestamps have been processed, and which messages were posted by the bot.

---

## File Location

```
{WORKSPACE_BASE_ROOT}/automation-state/slack_poller_{automation_id}.json
```

Where `WORKSPACE_BASE_ROOT` is derived by going two levels up from the
`WORKSPACE_BASE` environment variable (stripping `automation-runs/{run_id}`).

Example on a local install:

```
~/.openhands/workspaces/automation-state/slack_poller_abc12345-….json
```

The `automation_id` is read from the `AUTOMATION_EVENT_PAYLOAD` environment
variable (field `automation_id`).

## Top-Level Schema

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,                        // schema version (integer)
  "bot_user_id": "UBOTID123",          // Slack user_id of the bot/token owner
                                       // cached from auth.test; null until first run
  "last_poll": {
    "C0123456789": "1716576000.123456" // channel_id → float Unix timestamp (string)
                                       // set to (now - POLL_OVERLAP_SECONDS) at the
                                       // END of each run; pinned back if triggers fail
  },
  "conversations": { ... },            // see ConversationRecord below
  "bot_message_ts": [                  // rolling list of Slack 'ts' values for
    "1716576100.000200"                // messages THIS bot posted; used to skip
  ],                                   // self-messages during processing
  "processed_ts": [                    // rolling list of message ts values that have
    "1716576050.000100"                // already been fully handled (dedup across the
  ]                                    // overlap window between iterations)
}
```

## `conversations` Map

Key: `"{channel_id}:{thread_root_ts}"`  -  uniquely identifies a Slack thread.

Value: **ConversationRecord**

```jsonc
{
  // Required fields
  "conversation_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
                                      // OpenHands conversation UUID
  "channel_id":      "C0123456789",  // Slack channel ID
  "thread_ts":       "1716576000.000100",
                                      // Slack thread root timestamp
                                      // (= msg_ts for top-level trigger messages)
  "status":          "active",        // "active" | "closed"
  "last_activity":   1716576060.0,    // float Unix timestamp of the last time the
                                      // script sent a message to this conversation
                                      // (creation time, or time a reply was forwarded)
}
```

### `status` values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `active` | Conversation is running or awaiting more input; replies will be forwarded |
| `closed` | Summary has been posted to Slack; no further processing |

Closed conversations are retained in the map indefinitely (the map stays small
since there are < 10 channels and the trigger rate is typically low). If the
map grows unexpectedly, closed entries older than a configurable TTL can be
pruned.

---

## `bot_message_ts` List

A rolling list (max `MAX_BOT_TS = 2000` entries) of Slack `ts` values for
messages posted BY the bot. This prevents the script from treating its own
replies as user messages.

Entries are added when:
- The bot posts a conversation link (on trigger detection)
- The bot posts a summary (on conversation completion)

---

## `processed_ts` List

A rolling list (max `MAX_PROCESSED_TS = 2000` entries) of Slack `ts` values
for messages that have already been fully handled by this script.

Because `last_poll` is set to `(now - POLL_OVERLAP_SECONDS)` rather than
exactly `now`, messages near the boundary are re-fetched on the next iteration.
`processed_ts` provides a second deduplication layer that prevents these
re-fetched messages from being processed twice (e.g., triggering a duplicate
conversation or forwarding the same reply multiple times).

Entries are added when a message is either skipped (not human, already handled)
or successfully processed (trigger detected and conversation created, or reply
forwarded).
