# Slack Channel Monitor

Create a cron automation that polls up to 10 Slack channels every minute and
starts an OpenHands conversation whenever a configurable trigger phrase is
detected.

## Triggers

This skill is activated by keywords:

- `monitor a Slack channel`
- `watch Slack for messages`
- `Slack bot that responds to mentions`
- `OpenHands Slack integration`
- `trigger OpenHands from Slack`
- `respond to @openhands in Slack`
- `poll Slack channels`

## Features

- **Token auto-detection**: works with a bot token (`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`) or a
  user token (`SLACK_USER_TOKEN`); informs the user if neither is present
- **Channel name resolution**: resolves `#channel-name` to IDs, with graceful
  handling of permission errors
- **Configurable trigger phrase**: defaults to `@openhands`; any low-collision
  phrase works (e.g. `jazz hands`, `take-me-to-funky-town`)
- **Efficient polling**: single `search.messages` call for multi-channel user
  tokens with `search:read`; falls back to one `conversations.history` call
  per channel for bot tokens
- **Thread tracking**: new replies in a triggered thread are forwarded to the
  running OpenHands conversation
- **Reaction acknowledgement**: adds a 👀 to every message containing the
  trigger phrase
- **Conversation link**: posts a link to the new conversation in the Slack
  thread immediately on trigger detection
- **Automatic summaries**: when the conversation reaches a terminal state the
  agent's final response is posted back to the thread; error/stuck states
  receive a clear error notice
- **Persistent state**: conversation tracking and poll timestamps are stored
  in `automation-state/slack_poller_{automation_id}.json` across runs

## Prerequisites

Set at least one of the following in **OpenHands Settings - Secrets**:

| Secret | Token type | Minimum scopes |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | Bot (`xoxb-`) | `channels:history`, `channels:read`, `reactions:write`, `chat:write` |
| `SLACK_USER_TOKEN` | User (`xoxp-`) | Same as bot, plus `search:read` for multi-channel efficiency |

Optional:

| Secret | Default | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `OPENHANDS_URL` | `http://localhost:8000` | Base URL for conversation links posted in Slack |

## Quick Start

Ask OpenHands:

> "Monitor the #dev-help and #support Slack channels and start a conversation
> whenever someone says @openhands"

The skill will:

1. Verify your Slack token is available
2. Resolve channel names to IDs
3. Confirm the trigger phrase (or use the default `@openhands`)
4. Generate and upload a customised automation script by copying the template
   and changing only the configuration constants
5. Create the automation with cron schedule `* * * * *`

## How It Works

Each cron run (every minute):

1. Fetches new messages from all monitored channels
2. Adds 👀 to any message containing the trigger phrase
3. Creates an OpenHands conversation with the message and recent channel
   context as the initial prompt; posts a link to the conversation in the
   Slack thread
4. Forwards new replies in tracked threads to the running conversation
5. Checks active conversations - posts the agent's final response back to
   Slack when the conversation completes
