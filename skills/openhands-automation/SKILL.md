# OpenHands Automations

Create and manage automations that run in OpenHands Cloud sandboxes — triggered by cron schedules or webhook events (GitHub, custom services).

> **⚠️ CRITICAL — Agent behavior rules:**
>
> 0. **Does this task need an LLM at all? Check first.** Before picking a preset, ask whether the task actually requires reasoning, judgment, summarization, or open-ended tool use. If it is fully deterministic — fixed data transforms, scheduled HTTP calls, healthcheck pings, file rotation, picking from a known list, posting a templated message — an LLM-driven preset is overkill. Every run will spin up a sandbox and consume LLM tokens, which adds up fast at high frequencies (every 5 min ≈ 288 runs/day). Surface the trade-off to the user and offer the custom-script path (see `references/custom-automation.md`) as the cheaper, more reliable option. Be especially careful for cron schedules tighter than hourly.
> 1. **For LLM-appropriate work, default to preset endpoints.** They handle all SDK boilerplate, tarball packaging, and upload automatically:
>    - **Prompt preset** (`POST /v1/preset/prompt`) — for tasks expressed as a natural language prompt that benefit from agent reasoning
>    - **Plugin preset** (`POST /v1/preset/plugin`) — when plugins with skills, MCP configs, or commands are needed
> 2. **Do not silently create custom SDK scripts.** Do not generate Python SDK code, `setup.sh` files, or tarball uploads without user consent. But *do* proactively recommend the custom path (per rule 0) when the task is deterministic or high-frequency — surface the option and let the user choose.
> 3. **If neither preset is the right fit**, do NOT silently fall back to custom automation. Instead, explain the available options to the user:
>    - **Prompt preset** — natural language prompt execution (LLM-driven)
>    - **Plugin preset** — load plugins with extended capabilities (skills, MCP, hooks, commands)
>    - **Custom SDK script** — full control over code, no LLM required; point them to `references/custom-automation.md`
>    - Let the user choose which approach to use.
> 4. **Only create custom SDK scripts after the user agrees to that path.** Refer to `references/custom-automation.md` for the full reference.

## Authentication

All requests require Bearer authentication:

```bash
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}"
```

## API Endpoints

### Determining the API Host

**Before making API calls, determine the correct host:**

Look for a `<HOST>` value in the system prompt. If present, use that URL. Otherwise, default to `https://app.all-hands.dev`.

This ensures the correct host is used for the deployment environment (e.g., `https://staging.all-hands.dev` for staging, `https://app.all-hands.dev` for production).

### Automation Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/automation/v1/preset/prompt` | POST | **Create automation from a prompt (recommended)** |
| `/api/automation/v1/preset/plugin` | POST | **Create automation with plugins** |
| `/api/automation/v1` | GET | List automations |
| `/api/automation/v1/{id}` | GET | Get automation details |
| `/api/automation/v1/{id}` | PATCH | Update automation |
| `/api/automation/v1/{id}` | DELETE | Delete automation |
| `/api/automation/v1/{id}/dispatch` | POST | Trigger a run manually |
| `/api/automation/v1/{id}/runs` | GET | List automation runs |

### Custom Webhook Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/automation/v1/webhooks` | POST | Register a custom webhook source |
| `/api/automation/v1/webhooks` | GET | List all custom webhooks |
| `/api/automation/v1/webhooks/{id}` | GET | Get webhook details |
| `/api/automation/v1/webhooks/{id}` | PATCH | Update webhook settings |
| `/api/automation/v1/webhooks/{id}` | DELETE | Delete a webhook |
| `/api/automation/v1/webhooks/{id}/rotate-secret` | POST | Rotate signing secret |

---

## Trigger Types

Automations support two trigger types:

| Trigger Type | Use Case |
|--------------|----------|
| **Cron** | Run on a schedule (daily, weekly, hourly, etc.) |
| **Event** | Run when a webhook event occurs (GitHub PR opened, issue commented, etc.) |

---

## Creating Automations

Two preset endpoints simplify automation creation by handling SDK boilerplate, tarball packaging, and upload automatically:

1. **Prompt Preset** — Execute a natural language prompt (simple tasks)
2. **Plugin Preset** — Load plugins with skills, MCP configs, and commands (extended capabilities)

---

### Prompt Preset

Use the **preset/prompt endpoint** for simple automations. Provide a natural language prompt describing the task.

#### How It Works

1. Send a prompt describing the task (e.g., "Generate a weekly status report")
2. The service generates SDK boilerplate that connects to the user's OpenHands Cloud account, fetches their LLM config, secrets, and MCP server configuration, creates an AI agent conversation with the prompt, and reports completion
3. The service packages the code into a tarball, uploads it, and creates the automation

#### Request

```bash
curl -X POST "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1/preset/prompt" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Automation Name",
    "prompt": "What the automation should do",
    "trigger": {
      "type": "cron",
      "schedule": "0 9 * * *",
      "timezone": "UTC"
    }
  }'
```

#### Request Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Name of the automation (1-500 characters) |
| `prompt` | Yes | Natural language instructions (1-50,000 characters) |
| `trigger` | Yes | Trigger configuration — either `cron` or `event` (see below) |
| `timeout` | No | Max execution time in seconds (default: system maximum) |
| `repos` | No | Repositories to clone (see [Repository Cloning](#repository-cloning)) |

**Cron Trigger Fields:**

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `trigger.type` | Yes | `"cron"` |
| `trigger.schedule` | Yes | Cron expression (5 fields: min hour day month weekday) |
| `trigger.timezone` | No | IANA timezone (default: `"UTC"`) |

**Event Trigger Fields:**

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `trigger.type` | Yes | `"event"` |
| `trigger.source` | Yes | Event source: `"github"` or custom webhook source name |
| `trigger.on` | Yes | Event key pattern(s) to match (see Event Keys below) |
| `trigger.filter` | No | JMESPath expression for payload filtering (see Filter Expressions below) |

#### Prompt Tips

Write the prompt as an instruction to an AI agent. The prompt executes inside a sandbox with full tool access (bash, file editing, etc.), the user's configured LLM, stored secrets, and MCP server integrations. Examples:

- `"Generate a weekly status report summarizing the team's GitHub activity and post it to Slack"`
- `"Check the production API health endpoint every hour and alert if it returns non-200"`
- `"Pull the latest data from our analytics API and update the dashboard spreadsheet"`

#### Cron Schedule

| Field | Values | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Minute | 0-59 | Minute of the hour |
| Hour | 0-23 | Hour of the day (24-hour) |
| Day | 1-31 | Day of the month |
| Month | 1-12 | Month of the year |
| Weekday | 0-6 | Day of week (0=Sun, 6=Sat) |

Common schedules: `0 9 * * *` (daily 9 AM), `0 9 * * 1-5` (weekdays 9 AM), `0 9 * * 1` (Mondays 9 AM), `0 0 1 * *` (first of month), `*/15 * * * *` (every 15 min), `0 */6 * * *` (every 6 hours).

  }'
```

## Event-Triggered Automations (Webhooks)

Event-triggered automations run when a webhook event occurs — like a GitHub PR being opened, an issue receiving a comment, or a custom service sending a notification.

### Built-in Integrations

**GitHub** is a built-in integration — no webhook registration needed. Just create automations with `"source": "github"`.

### GitHub Event Keys

Events use the format `{event_type}.{action}` or just `{event_type}` (for events without actions like `push`).

| Event Type | Event Keys | Description |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| `pull_request` | `pull_request.opened`, `pull_request.closed`, `pull_request.synchronize`, `pull_request.labeled`, `pull_request.unlabeled`, `pull_request.reopened`, `pull_request.edited`, `pull_request.ready_for_review` | PR activity |
| `issues` | `issues.opened`, `issues.closed`, `issues.reopened`, `issues.labeled`, `issues.unlabeled`, `issues.edited`, `issues.assigned` | Issue activity |
| `issue_comment` | `issue_comment.created`, `issue_comment.edited`, `issue_comment.deleted` | Comments on issues/PRs |
| `push` | `push` | Code pushed to a branch |
| `release` | `release.published`, `release.created`, `release.released`, `release.prereleased` | Release activity |
| `pull_request_review` | `pull_request_review.submitted`, `pull_request_review.edited`, `pull_request_review.dismissed` | PR review activity |

**Wildcards:** Use `*` to match any action — e.g., `pull_request.*` matches all PR events.

**Multiple patterns:** The `on` field can be a string or array — e.g., `["push", "pull_request.opened"]`.

### Filter Expressions (JMESPath)

Filters let you match events based on payload content using JMESPath expressions.

#### Available Functions

| Function | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `glob(str, pattern)` | Wildcard pattern matching | `glob(repository.full_name, 'myorg/*')` |
| `icontains(str, substr)` | Case-insensitive substring | `icontains(comment.body, '@openhands')` |
| `contains(array, value)` | Array contains value | `contains(pull_request.labels[].name, 'bug')` |
| `regex(str, pattern)` | Regular expression match | `regex(ref, '^refs/tags/v\\d+')` |
| `starts_with(str, prefix)` | String starts with | `starts_with(ref, 'refs/heads/')` |
| `ends_with(str, suffix)` | String ends with | `ends_with(ref, '/main')` |
| `lower(str)` / `upper(str)` | Case conversion | `lower(sender.login) == 'admin'` |

#### Boolean Operators

- `&&` — AND
- `||` — OR  
- `!` — NOT

#### Filter Examples

```javascript
// Exact match on label name
"contains(pull_request.labels[].name, 'openhands')"

// Case-insensitive mention in comment
"icontains(comment.body, '@openhands')"

// Match specific repository
"repository.full_name == 'myorg/myrepo'"

// Match any repo in an org
"glob(repository.full_name, 'myorg/*')"

// PR with 'bug' label in any org repo
"glob(repository.full_name, 'myorg/*') && contains(pull_request.labels[].name, 'bug')"

// Push to main or release branches
"glob(ref, 'refs/heads/main') || glob(ref, 'refs/heads/release/*')"

// Issue opened by a specific user
"sender.login == 'dependabot[bot]'"

// Not a draft PR
"!pull_request.draft"
```

## Custom Webhooks

For services other than GitHub (Linear, Stripe, Slack, etc.), register a custom webhook first.

> **Agent behavior:**
> - **Always provide the curl request** to the user — do not attempt to register webhooks yourself.
> - **Ask the user:** "Do you have a webhook signing secret from [service], or should the system generate one?"
>   - If they have one → include `webhook_secret` in the request
>   - If not → omit it; the response will contain a generated secret they must configure in their service

### Register a Custom Webhook

```bash
curl -X POST "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1/webhooks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Linear Issues",
    "source": "linear",
    "event_key_expr": "type",
    "signature_header": "Linear-Signature",
    "webhook_secret": "your-linear-webhook-secret"
  }'
```

#### Webhook Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Human-readable name for the webhook |
| `source` | Yes | Unique source identifier (lowercase, alphanumeric with hyphens, 1-50 chars) |
| `event_key_expr` | No | JMESPath expression to extract event type from payload (default: `"type"`) |
| `signature_header` | No | HTTP header containing HMAC signature (default: `"X-Signature-256"`) |
| `webhook_secret` | No | Signing secret — provide your own (from the external service) or let the system generate one |

#### Response

```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "webhook_url": "https://app.all-hands.dev/v1/events/{org_id}/linear",
  "source": "linear",
  "enabled": true
}
```

**Note:** When you provide your own `webhook_secret`, it won't be echoed back in the response. If you don't provide one, the system generates a secret and returns it once — store it securely.

### Manage Custom Webhooks

```bash
# List all webhooks
curl "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1/webhooks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}"

# Update a webhook
curl -X PATCH "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1/webhooks/{webhook_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"enabled": false}'

# Rotate the signing secret
curl -X POST "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1/webhooks/{webhook_id}/rotate-secret" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}"

# Delete a webhook
curl -X DELETE "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1/webhooks/{webhook_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}"
```

### Custom Webhook Example: Linear

Linear sends webhooks with:
- Signature header: `Linear-Signature`
- Event type in payload: `type` field (e.g., `Issue`, `Comment`, `Project`)
- Action in payload: `action` field (e.g., `create`, `update`, `remove`)

```bash
# 1. Register the Linear webhook
#    - Get your webhook signing secret from Linear's webhook settings
#    - Use "Linear-Signature" as the signature header
#    - Use "type" to extract the event type from the payload
curl -X POST "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1/webhooks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Linear Issues",
    "source": "linear",
    "event_key_expr": "type",
    "signature_header": "Linear-Signature",
    "webhook_secret": "lin_wh_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  }'

# Response includes webhook_url — configure this in Linear:
# Settings → API → Webhooks → New webhook → paste the webhook_url

# 2. Create an automation for new Linear issues
curl -X POST "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1/preset/prompt" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Triage New Linear Issues",
    "prompt": "A new issue was created in Linear. Analyze the issue title and description, suggest appropriate labels, and add a comment with initial triage notes.",
    "trigger": {
      "type": "event",
      "source": "linear",
      "on": "Issue",
      "filter": "action == '\''create'\''"
    }
  }'

# 3. Create an automation for high-priority issue updates
curl -X POST "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1/preset/prompt" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "High Priority Issue Alert",
    "prompt": "A high-priority issue was updated. Review the changes and notify the team if action is needed.",
    "trigger": {
      "type": "event",
      "source": "linear",
      "on": "Issue",
      "filter": "action == '\''update'\'' && data.priority == `1`"
    }
  }'
```

### Common Signature Headers by Service

| Service | Signature Header | Event Key Expression |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Linear | `Linear-Signature` | `type` |
| Stripe | `Stripe-Signature` | `type` |
| Slack | `X-Slack-Signature` | `type` |
| Twilio | `X-Twilio-Signature` | `type` |
| Generic | `X-Signature-256` | `type` |

### Plugin Preset

Use the **preset/plugin endpoint** when you need to load one or more plugins that provide extended capabilities like skills, MCP configurations, hooks, and commands.

> **💡 Finding plugins:** Browse the [OpenHands/extensions](https://github.com/OpenHands/extensions) repository for available skills and plugins. When given a broad use case, check this directory first to see if something already exists that fits your needs.

#### How It Works

1. Specify one or more plugins (from GitHub repos, git URLs, or monorepo subdirectories)
2. Provide a prompt that can invoke plugin commands (e.g., `/plugin-name:command`)
3. The service generates SDK boilerplate that loads all plugins at runtime, creates a conversation with plugin capabilities, and executes the prompt
4. The service packages everything into a tarball, uploads it, and creates the automation

#### Request

```bash
curl -X POST "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1/preset/plugin" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Plugin Automation",
    "plugins": [
      {"source": "github:owner/repo", "ref": "v1.0.0"},
      {"source": "github:owner/another-plugin"}
    ],
    "prompt": "Use the plugin commands to perform the task",
    "trigger": {
      "type": "cron",
      "schedule": "0 9 * * 1",
      "timezone": "UTC"
    }
  }'
```

#### Request Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Name of the automation (1-500 characters) |
| `plugins` | Yes | List of plugin sources (at least one required) |
| `plugins[].source` | Yes | Plugin source: `github:owner/repo`, git URL, or local path |
| `plugins[].ref` | No | Git ref: branch, tag, or commit SHA |
| `plugins[].repo_path` | No | Subdirectory path for monorepos |
| `prompt` | Yes | Instructions for the automation (1-50,000 characters) |
| `trigger` | Yes | Trigger configuration — either `cron` or `event` (same as Prompt Preset) |
| `timeout` | No | Max execution time in seconds (default: system maximum) |
| `repos` | No | Repositories to clone (see [Repository Cloning](#repository-cloning)) |

#### Plugin Source Formats

| Format | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| GitHub shorthand | `github:owner/repo` | Fetches from GitHub |
| Git URL | `https://github.com/owner/repo.git` | Any git repository |
| With ref | `{"source": "github:owner/repo", "ref": "v1.0.0"}` | Specific branch/tag/commit |
| Monorepo | `{"source": "github:org/monorepo", "repo_path": "plugins/my-plugin"}` | Subdirectory in repo |

## Repository Cloning

Both presets support an optional `repos` field to clone repositories into the sandbox before execution. Cloned repos have their skills (AGENTS.md, `.agents/skills/`) automatically loaded.

### Repo Source Formats

| Format | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Full URL | `"https://github.com/owner/repo"` | Provider auto-detected |
| Full URL + ref | `{"url": "https://github.com/owner/repo", "ref": "main"}` | With branch/tag/SHA |
| Short URL | `{"url": "owner/repo", "provider": "github"}` | Requires `provider` field |

**Supported providers:** `github`, `gitlab`, `bitbucket`

> **Note:** Short URLs (`owner/repo`) require an explicit `provider` field. Full URLs auto-detect the provider.

### Examples

**Single repo (full URL):**
```json
{
  "repos": ["https://github.com/OpenHands/openhands-cli"]
}
```

**Multiple repos with refs:**
```json
{
  "repos": [
    {"url": "https://github.com/owner/repo1", "ref": "main"},
    {"url": "https://gitlab.com/owner/repo2", "ref": "v1.0.0"}
  ]
}
```

**Short URL with provider:**
```json
{
  "repos": [
    {"url": "owner/repo", "provider": "github", "ref": "main"}
  ]
}
```

### Complete Automation Example

```bash
curl -X POST "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1/preset/prompt" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Analyze Codebase",
    "prompt": "Analyze the openhands-cli codebase and generate a summary report",
    "trigger": {"type": "cron", "schedule": "0 9 * * 1"},
    "repos": [
      {"url": "https://github.com/OpenHands/openhands-cli", "ref": "main"}
    ]
  }'
```

## Managing Automations

### List Automations

```bash
curl "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1?limit=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}"
```

### Get / Update / Delete

```bash
# Get details
curl "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1/{automation_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}"

# Update (fields: name, trigger, enabled, timeout)
curl -X PATCH "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1/{automation_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"enabled": false}'

# Delete
curl -X DELETE "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1/{automation_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}"
```

### Trigger and Monitor Runs

```bash
# Manually trigger a run
curl -X POST "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1/{automation_id}/dispatch" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}"

# List runs
curl "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1/{automation_id}/runs?limit=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENHANDS_API_KEY}"
```

Run status values: `PENDING` (waiting for dispatch), `RUNNING` (in progress), `COMPLETED` (success), `FAILED` (check `error_detail`).

## Sandbox Lifecycle

After a run completes, the sandbox is **kept alive** by default — users can view the conversation history in the OpenHands UI and continue interacting. The sandbox persists until it times out or is manually deleted.

## Choosing the Right Preset

Pick based on **what the task needs**, not just **what is technically possible**. An LLM-driven preset can do almost anything, so "the preset can satisfy this" is not by itself a good reason to pick it — every run costs tokens and sandbox time.

| Use Case | Recommended |
|----------|-------------|
| Reasoning, summarization, triage, code review, or open-ended tool use | **Prompt Preset** |
| Needs plugin commands / skills / MCP configs / hooks | **Plugin Preset** |
| **Deterministic task** (fixed data + scheduled action, e.g. healthcheck, templated notification, rotating from a known list) — especially if it runs frequently | **Custom SDK script** (no LLM) — see `references/custom-automation.md` |
| Custom Python dependencies, non-Python entrypoint, multi-file project structure, direct SDK lifecycle control | **Custom Automation** (see below) |

The **prompt preset** is the right default for genuinely agent-shaped work — anything that benefits from reasoning over context, calling tools dynamically, or producing a non-templated output. Use the **plugin preset** when you need extended capabilities from plugins (skills, MCP configurations, hooks, commands).

**Watch for deterministic, high-frequency patterns.** Requests like "send a daily standup reminder", "ping a healthcheck URL every minute", "post a random quote every 5 minutes", or "rotate a fact-of-the-day message" do not need an LLM. Surface this to the user explicitly with a rough cost framing (e.g. "this schedule will invoke your LLM ~288 times/day") before defaulting to a preset. As a rule of thumb, any cron tighter than hourly deserves a deliberate "should this really be agent-driven?" check.

**When neither preset is the right fit** (deterministic task, custom Python dependencies, non-Python entrypoint, multi-file project structure, direct SDK lifecycle control), explain the options to the user and let them decide. Do not attempt custom automation without explicit user agreement. If they choose the custom route, refer to `references/custom-automation.md`.

## Reference Files

- **`references/custom-automation.md`** — Detailed guide for custom automations: tarball uploads, SDK code structure, environment variables, validation rules, and complete examples. Consult this whenever you need to evaluate or recommend the custom path (including for deterministic / cost-sensitive tasks per rule 0). Only *implement* a custom automation after the user agrees to that path.
